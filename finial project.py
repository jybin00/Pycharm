# Goal: Finding articulation points in a graph
# •  Input:  three different connected undirected graphs with vertices >= 10 and A.Ps >= 3
# • Algorithm sketches are given in the textbook and slides
#
#
# • Output: For each graph, print
#
#
# –Original graph
#
#
# –Num values of all vertices
#
#
# –Low values of all vertices
#
#
# –All the articulation points and extra information to show how your
# program can find out those articulation points.
